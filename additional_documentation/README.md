This directory contains a number of files which just give additional info on some issues pertinent to the codes.

The file DOC_sphervec.pdf is taken from one of the appendices from my PhD thesis from 1998 and provides relations for spherical vector harmonics. An understanding of these is necessary if you intend to go into the source code.

The file DOC_appkeysubs.pdf provides some information about key subroutines in the package.

The file DOC_fundamentals.pdf provides the basic equations and details about the numerical representation of functions.

The LaTeX files are just provided for the interested reader.
